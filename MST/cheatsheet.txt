/*
    STEPS FOR KRUSHKAL'S ALGORITHM:
    1. sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight
    2. create a parent array and rank array for union-find
    3. iterate through all the edges:
        a. for each edge, check if the two vertices belong to different components using find operation
        b. if they do, include this edge in the mst and perform union operation to merge the components

/*
    STEPS FOR PRIMS ALGORITHM:
    1. create a min heap to store the edges with minimum weight
    2. create a visited array to keep track of visited nodes
    3. push the root node into the min heap with weight 0 --> MEANS THAT WE ARE STARTING FROM THE ROOT NODE
    4. while the min heap is not empty:
        a. pop the top element from the min heap
        b. if the node is already visited, continue
        c. mark the node as visited
        d. add the edge to the mst
        e. for each adjacent node of the current node:
            i. if the adjacent node is not visited, push it into the min heap with its weight
